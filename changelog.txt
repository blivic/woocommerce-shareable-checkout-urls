= 1.3 =
* New: Modular file structure
* UTM & Pixel Tracking
  – Clean-URL tracking – UTM tags don't bloat the shareable link; appended only on redirect.
  – Meta-pixel support – Specify a Pixel ID globally or per-link; fires client-side from session.
  – Granular control – New “Global / Custom / None” toggle under each link + master “Enable Tracking” switch in Woo → Advanced.
* New: REST API endpoints under `/wp-json/scu/v1/links`  
  – CRUD: Manage shareable-checkout links via REST endpoints
  – All routes check against the “Minimum Role to Access SCU” setting via `mx_scu_current_user_has_access()`.
* Fix: General bug-fixes & cleanup

= 1.2 =
* New: Optional product validation caching (60 min, auto-cleared on product updates)
* New: "Clear Validation Cache" button in settings
* New: Tracks link usage, calculates conversion rate and revenue per SCU link
* New: Added sortable admin columns: Usage, Orders, Conversion Rate, Revenue
* New: Debug Mode logs cache hits, validation results, coupons, and redirects to debug.log
* New: Added support for displaying a custom promo message on the checkout page when a shareable URL is used.
  – Users can choose between showing message as a WooCommerce notice or a custom block.
  – Promo message supports basic HTML formatting (e.g. `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a href="">`).
  – Custom block is automatically moved above all WooCommerce notices for better visibility.
* Added: Usage limit feature for Shareable Checkout URLs. Admins can now set a maximum allowed uses per link. Once the limit is reached:
  – The link is automatically set to draft (disabled).
  – Visitors see a "This checkout link is no longer available." message when accessing expired links.
  – Usage count is tracked and displayed in the SCU admin list.
  – Unlimited usage remains the default (when field is empty or zero).
* Improved: Centralized validation logic for better reliability
* New: “Minimum Role to Access SCU” option in WooCommerce Advanced → Shareable URLs
* New: mx_scu_current_user_has_access() enforces that setting across:
  – Admin menu, post list, meta-boxes, save_post, AJAX search endpoints, settings screen  
  – Shows a dismissible notice on SCU edit/add pages when access is denied  
  – Removes SCU menu for users below the selected role
